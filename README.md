# My Website

This is the code that runs the [website that I develop](www.dylan-shah.com). 

When I create .env files, I will try to remember to commit a template 
version of the env file, that states the names of required secrets, 
to allow you to easily add them.


To run it, install docker, and run the docker compose file. 

If there are any errors or suggestions, feel free to create a pull request or issue on Github, 
or email me at [website.errors@dylan-shah.com](mailto:website.errors@dylan-shah.com)
